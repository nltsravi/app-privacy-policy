# Privacy Policy for QSO Log – Ham Radio Logger

**Last Updated:** August 11, 2025

## 1. Introduction
QSO Log – Ham Radio Logger (“the App”) is developed to help amateur (ham) radio operators log their QSOs quickly, accurately, and securely.
Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy explains how your data is handled when you use the App.

## 2. Data Collection & Usage
We **do not** collect, store, or share any personal information on our servers. All QSO data, settings, and preferences are stored **locally on your device**.

The App may optionally use **Apple iCloud** to sync your data between your devices.

- Your data is stored in your private iCloud account, managed by Apple.
- We do not have access to your iCloud data.

## 3. Types of Data Stored
The App stores the following **locally on your device** (and in iCloud if sync is enabled):

- QSO logs (callsign, date/time, band, mode, RST, frequency, station profile, notes)
- Station profiles
- App settings (preferences, enabled bands/modes)

This data is only used to provide the logging functionality of the App.

## 4. No Internet Tracking or Ads
- The App contains **no third-party advertising**.
- The App contains **no analytics or tracking SDKs**.
- We do not track your activity inside the App.

## 5. Optional Third-Party Integrations
If you enable optional features such as **Callsign Lookup** (HamQTH, QRZ, etc.), you may be required to enter credentials for those services.

- These credentials are stored securely on your device.
- Requests are sent directly to the chosen service.
- We do not intercept, store, or share this information.

## 6. Data Sharing
We do not share your data with anyone. The only time your QSO data leaves your device is:

- When you **export** your log (ADIF, CSV) via the Share menu.
- When you enable **iCloud sync**, in which case Apple’s iCloud service handles secure storage and transfer.

## 7. Your Control Over Data
You can:

- **Delete any QSO or Station Profile** from within the App.
- **Clear all data** by uninstalling the App from your device.
- Disable **iCloud sync** at any time via App Settings or your iOS Settings → Apple ID → iCloud.

## 8. Security
- All local storage is within Apple’s app sandbox.
- iCloud data is encrypted by Apple during transfer and at rest.

## 9. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted within the App and on the App Store listing.
